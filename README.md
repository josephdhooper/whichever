# All Gender
This iOS app (iPhone only) utilizes the [Realm] (https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/) mobile database to store and persist gender-neutral bathroom data and [Haneke](https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift) to cache images. UNC-CH community members can use the app to view bathroom locations on a map (utilizing [MapBox SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/ios-sdk/)) or they can locate specific information about the bathroom using a search controller. For example, users can obtain the bathroom room number, floor number, availability (public or limited), signage and details. The app is meant to be simple for users: Look and Locate.

NB: This project originally used Carthage, but now it utilizes cocoapods for MapboxDirections, Polyline and HanekeSwift.
